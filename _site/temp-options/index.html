	<p><strong>If I am expecting a baby, how far in advance of my due date may I stop working?</strong></p>
	You may stop working on your own accord within one week of your expected due date. In order to stop working prior to that, you need to submit medical documentation from your physician stating the need to stop working.</p>

	<h4>Frequently Asked Questions:</h4>
		<div id="list">
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If I am a 10-month employee and my baby is born in the summer, am I eligible for FMLA in the fall?</h3>
			<div class="hide hide--content">
				<p>You may take FMLA at the start of the school year, as FMLA allows an employee to be absent for 60 working days. You will be able to use earned/unearned sick leave for the period in which you are under doctor’s care for a medical recovery period (6-8 weeks). If you deliver during the summer, and your medical recovery period extends through the start of the school year, you are able to use earned/unearned sick leave for the number of duty days that you miss at the start of the school year. If your medical recovery period expires before the start of the school year, but you are still on an approved leave of absence, you will no longer be eligible to use your earned/unearned sick leave. If you do not miss any duty days in connection with your pregnancy, you will not be charged any leave.</p>
				<p><strong>Example:</strong> Your baby is born July 3, and your doctor says you may return to work after six weeks, which would be August 14. When school starts you would be able to take leave until the middle of November, but it would be unpaid because it is after the date your doctor has designated as the date you may return to work.</p>
			</div>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Are non-scheduled work days counted in the disability period for child birth?</h3>
			<div class="hide hide--content">
				<p>Yes, non-scheduled work days are counted in the disability period for child birth. </p>
				<p>For instance: If the disability period occurs during Spring Break, the non-scheduled days count towards the disability period. However, you will not be charged sick or personal leave on non-scheduled days.</p>
			</div>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What happens if the baby is not delivered on the expected date?</h3>
				<p class="hide">If the baby is delivered early, the employee will need to contact Human Resources and submit the verification of birth and delivery type. If the baby is not delivered on the expected date and you continue to work, contact Human Resources.</p>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If I am expecting a baby, how far in advance of my due date may I stop working?</h3>
				<p class="hide">You may stop working on your own accord within one week of your expected due date. In order to stop working prior to that, you need to submit medical documentation from your physician stating the need to stop working.</p>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How much leave may a husband and wife take if they are both employed by HCPSS?</h3>
			<div class="hide hide--content">
				<p>Spouses employed by the same employer are limited in the amount of leave they may take for the birth and care of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care to a combined total of 12 work weeks (or 26 work weeks if leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness is also used).   Leave for birth and care, or placement for adoption or foster care, must conclude within 12 months of birth or placement.</p>
				<p><strong>Example:</strong> If spouses are employed by HCPSS and the wife takes 10 weeks FMLA for the birth of a child, and the husband takes 2 weeks of FMLA to care for the child, then the husband will still have 10 weeks of FMLA available to take for his own personal illness and the wife will have 2 weeks available for her own personal illness, if needed.</p>
			</div>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What should I do when the baby is born?</h3>
				<p class="hide">Contact Pamela Saulsbury via phone or email with the birth date.  Fax a verification of birth and delivery type (regular or cesarean section) to Pamela Saulsbury 410-313-1565(fax). To add the baby to your health insurance, send the verification of birth and Benefits Change Form to the Benefits Office within 30 days after the birth.</p>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What If I get sick when I am pregnant or my doctor puts me on bedrest?</h3>
				<p class="hide">If you become ill for a pregnancy related condition, you may utilize your leave as you would for any normal circumstance (i.e. sick, personal, annual) and should contact the Office of Human Resources to inquire about next steps pertaining to your leave.</p>

    <div id="list">
      <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What if I do not have enough applicable paid leave (sick, annual, personal) to cover my leave of absence? </h3>

      <p class="hide">Per HCPSS Policy 7100-IP, once any/all required leave types have been exhausted, The Office of Human Resources may approve the use of unpaid leave for employee leaves of absence. </p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What if I have exhausted my FMLA eligibility but am still sick? </h3>

      <p class="hide">Per HCPSS Policy 7100-IP, Employees are expected to return to work immediately following the expiration of FMLA leave. However, if an eligible employee is unable to return to work at the expiration of the FMLA leave, the employee may request approval for additional leave under another designated type of leave available to employees. Such requests must follow procedures and criteria established by the Office of Human Resources.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Do I need a doctor’s note to return to work? </h3>
      <div class="hide hide--content">
      <p>Per HCPSS Policy 7100-IP, prior to returning to work, an employee on FMLA leave for his/her own serious health condition is required to submit a physician’s certification stating that the employee is able to perform the functions of the job. </p>

      <p>If, when applying for leave, your healthcare provider does not provide a return date, you must provide the Office of Human Resources an updated release to return to work one week prior to the estimated end of your leave of absence. </p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Without a full release to return to work from your physician, you may not return to work.</p>
