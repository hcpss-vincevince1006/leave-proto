<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div id="list">
<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Is FMLA leave paid or unpaid?</h3>
<div class="hide hide--content">
<p><strong>FMLA is not automatically paid leave.</strong> Pay during FMLA leave is governed by HCPSS paid leave practices and by the provisions of paid leave outlined in our respective negotiated agreements. The use of earned leave is optional, but not required. Eligible employees who exhaust all paid leave may still take approved FMLA as unpaid leave.</p>

<p>For maternity/paternity leave, you may only use your earned sick leave during the disability/recuperation period of your leave (the first 6-8 weeks, depending on the type of birth). The use of other earned leave is optional after the recuperation period.</p>

<p>You may use your earned sick leave to care for a child, parent, or spouse who has a serious health condition based upon the provisions in your current negotiated agreement. Please refer to your negotiated agreement to determine how many sick days you can use to care for a family member. The use of other earned leave is optional. Eligible employees who exhaust all paid leave may still take approved FMLA as unpaid leave.</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What if I am not eligible for FMLA?</h3>
<p class="hide">Complete the paperwork for your leave situation regardless of whether or not you believe you may be eligible. HCPSS will review your leave request for approval.</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Does FMLA have to be taken all at once, or can it be taken intermittently?</h3>
<p class="hide">Intermittent leave may be available if medically necessary for the employee’s own serious health condition or that of an immediate family member. Medical documentation must be provided prior to the approval of the leave. There are some special rules for instructional employees which may require the employee to take the leave all at once. Please consult with Human Resources for further information. </p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Does FMLA include military leave?</h3>
<p class="hide">FMLA permits “a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin” to take up to 26 work weeks of leave to care for a “member of the Armed forces, including a member of the National Guard of Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, or is otherwise in an outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness.</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What dates do I put on the leave of absence form?</h3>
<div class="hide hide--content">
<p>Maternity Leave - The estimated due date for the baby is used as the start date. The end date would be the last day of your leave before you plan on returning to work.</p>
<p>Personal Illness or Family illness – The first working day you are off work for that illness is used as the start date. The end date is the last day you will be off for this illness. This date is often estimated and can be adjusted with proper medical documentation.</p>
